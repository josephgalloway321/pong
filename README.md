Special thank you to "Programming With Nick" for creating the Pong tutorial that taught me about Raylib and C++ as well as the template to allow me to use VS Code. 
The template can be found [here](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2), and the tutorial for part of this pong game can be found [here](https://youtu.be/VLJlTaFvHo4?si=C_FO9tvcpkulfTlc).
